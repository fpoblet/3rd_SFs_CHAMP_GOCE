# Project Overview

This repository contains routines for processing cross-track wind observations from the CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and the Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellites. These observations are utilized to calculate third-order Structure Functions (SFs) as a function of horizontal separation across different altitudinal ranges.

## Data Sources

The CHAMP and GOCE satellite data used in this project can be accessed at the following locations:
- [Thermosphere at TU Delft](http://thermosphere.tudelft.nl/)
- [Siemes, C. et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1051/swsc/2023014)

## Results

The results of this investigation were published in 2024 in a Geophysical Research Letters paper. You can access the publication here: [https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108367](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108367).
